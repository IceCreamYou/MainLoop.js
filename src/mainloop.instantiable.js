             * A naive way to move an object along its X-axis might be to write a main
             * loop containing the statement `obj.x += 10;` which would move the object
             * 10 units per frame. This approach suffers from the issue that it is
             * dependent on the frame rate. In other words, if your application is
             * running slowly (that is, fewer frames per second), your object will also
             * appear to move slowly, whereas if your application is running quickly
             * (that is, more frames per second), your object will appear to move
             * quickly. This is undesirable, especially in multiplayer/multi-user
             * applications.
             *
             * One solution is to multiply the speed by the amount of time that has
             * passed between rendering frames. For example, if you want your object to
             * move 600 units per second, you might write `obj.x += 600 * delta`, where
             * `delta` is the time passed since the last frame. (For convenience, let's
             * move this statement to an update() function that takes `delta` as a
             * parameter.) This way, your object will move a constant distance over
             * time. However, at low frame rates and high speeds, your object will move
             * large distances every frame, which can cause it to do strange things
             * such as move through walls. Additionally, we would like our program to
             * be deterministic. That is, every time we run the application with the
             * same input, we would like exactly the same output. If the time between
             * frames (the `delta`) varies, our output will diverge the longer the
             * program runs due to accumulated rounding errors, even at normal frame
             * rates.
             *
             * A better solution is to separate the amount of time simulated in each
             * update() from the amount of time between frames. Our update() function
             * doesn't need to change; we just need to change the delta we pass to it
             * so that each update() simulates a fixed amount of time (that is, `delta`
             * should have the same value each time update() is called). The update()
             * function can be run multiple times per frame if needed to simulate the
             * total amount of time passed since the last frame. (If the time that has
             * passed since the last frame is less than the fixed simulation time, we
             * just won't run an update() until the the next frame. If there is
             * unsimulated time left over that is less than our timestep, we'll just
             * leave it to be simulated during the next frame.) This approach avoids
             * inconsistent rounding errors and ensures that there are no giant leaps
             * through walls between frames.
             *
             * That is what is done below. It introduces a new problem, but it is a
             * manageable one: if the amount of time spent simulating is consistently
             * longer than the amount of time between frames, the application could
             * freeze and crash in a spiral of death. This won't happen as long as the
             * fixed simulation time is set to a value that is high enough that
             * update() calls usually take less time than the amount of time they're
             * simulating. If it does start to happen anyway, see `MainLoop.setEnd()`
             * for a discussion of ways to stop it.

             *   It could be the rendering that is the bottleneck, in which case the
             *   solution is to decrease the visual complexity of the scene.
             * - It doesn't make sense to move the *entire* contents of update() into
             *   workers unless {@link #setDraw draw}() can interpolate between frames.
             *   The lowest-hanging fruit is background updates (like calculating
             *   citizens' happiness in a city-building game), physics that doesn't
             *   affect the scene (like flags waving in the wind), and anything that is
             *   occluded or happening far off screen.
             * - If draw() needs to interpolate physics based on activity that occurs
             *   in a worker, the worker needs to pass the interpolation value back to
             *   the main thread so that is is available to draw().
             * - Web Workers can't access the state of the main thread, so they can't
             *   directly modify objects in your scene. Moving data to and from Web
             *   Workers is a pain. The fastest way to do it is with Transferable
             *   Objects: basically, you can pass an ArrayBuffer to a worker,
             *   destroying the original reference in the process.
